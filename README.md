# Data-Analysis-Project

This report is a collection of data from different sources to build an understanding of the correlation (if any) between how far people live from a green or blue space, their general health and the level of crimes occurring in their area. The focus is on Scottish local authorities and the data allows for a direct comparison between each of them.

I have imported three sets of data on green spaces, general level of health and level of crimes in Scottish local authorities. I have put them on separate tabs in one workbook. 
After cleaning each dataset individually, I analysed the data and created correlations.
